          <h2>Inventing</h2>
            <p>
              I tend to come up with a new invention every day. I see something
              and I instantly think of ways to imrpove it or think of a completetly
              new idea. Sometimes they can be a bit more out of reach, but when they
              are something that can be realistic in our current years then I make
              sure to write it down in my book of ideas. Then, I list these ideas
              in an order from which I am able to complete them. So, if I invented
              a new drone versus a new garbage can I would rank the garbage canvas
              above the drone. This is based off of my current knowledge,
              accessibility, reasonability, and time. Each day I come up with a
              new idea means that each day there after is more likely to be a
              better idea. This hobby, or trait, of mine makes me view the world
              in a different perspective.

            <h2>Volleyball</h2>
              <p>
                I started playing volleyball near the end of 9th grade. I originally
                was a waterpolo player, however, my school did not offer waterpolo
                as a sport. This led me to try out for volleyball. I already had
                the coaches looking at mm and with being brand new to the sport I
                was not expecting this. Once I made the highschool team I started
                to fall in love with the sport. I was already a naturally high jumper
                and now in the sport of volleyball where jumping is a high valued
                skill, second to being naturally tall which is not my specialty,
                it made volleyball seem like the right fit. I considered it out
                of water waterpolo: instead of treading water and throwing balls,
                you were jumping and hitting them. Now, I am a player at IIT while
                I get my master's degree in ITM. Practicing both on and off the
                court with the other players is great way to workout and have a great
                time. It is not just a sport to me, but also one of my favorite
                hobbies.
                I started to play beach volleyball recently over summer break width
                an Olympic Beach Volleyball player and now everytime I am back
                in Florida I prefer to play volleyball on the beach, rather than
                indoor or grass.

            <h2>Exploring Food</h2>
              <p>
                Just like most people I am in love with food and love to explore
                all the different types and cultures. Now that I live in Chicago,
                a city full of different foods, I get to explore not only the
                amazing architecture and wonders of the city but also the amazing
                variants of foods and classical Chicago "dishes". One day I wish
                to travel the world and visit some of the best known places for
                cultural foods.

            <h2>Biking</h2>
              <p>
                I used to bike almsot every day with my friends as a kid. Unfortunately,
                I stopped biking for many years. However, once I moved to Chicago
                I noticed there were bike stations all of the city. One day I rented
                one of these bikes and rode it all around the city and beautiful
                beaches. Now on the weekends I like to take my friends out Biking
                for either exercise or for the experience and to show them what
                I discovered around the city while biking. Now it has become a
                hobby for not only me, but my roomates and friends who like to join.

            <h2>Calisthenics</h2>
              <p>
                I had a home gym back in Florida and even here in Chicago I have
                plenty of access to gyms and equipment. However, I ahve always
                been the type of person who prefers Calisthenics. For those treading
                who do not know, Calisthenics are workout using the weight of their
                body. This will typically include handstand push-ups, pull-ups,
                planks, sit-ups, and many extreme exercises that allow a person
                to completely lift their body off the ground in many ways (and hold
                extreme positions for long period of time). This is my prefered
                form of staying fit and in a great tone body shape.
